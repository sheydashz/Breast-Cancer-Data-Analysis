# Breast-Cancer-Data-Analysis

In this project we explore different aspects of analysing the dataset containing different features of breast tumors and whether they were malignent or benign. Our project contains the following steps:

### 1) data exploration and data cleansing
### 2) data visualization
### 3) Dimension reduction using PCA and LDA
### 4) investigating different metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
### 4) Classification using: Logistic regression, SVM, RandomForests, and Neural networks. 

For our simulations we primarily use numpy, sklearn, and pytorch.
